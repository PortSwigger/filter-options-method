<p>A Burp extension that filters out <code>OPTIONS</code> requests from populating Burp's Proxy history. This extension works by doing the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Force the &quot;Content-Type&quot; header value to &quot;text/css&#59; charset&#61;UTF-8&quot;.</li>
	<li>Comment out the entire response body so Burp will not recognize the MIME type incorrectly.</li>
</ol>
